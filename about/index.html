        more and better their skills, skärva is always open to discuss taking on contract work in addition to
        pursuing their own ideas and projects.</p>
    <p>skärva also takes great pride in sharing knowledge and supporting open source software; using it first and
        foremost when possible, and even contribute and advocate how they can. Their preferred
